# Process Scheduling Algorithms in Java

This repository contains Java implementations of various process scheduling algorithms. The included algorithms are First-Come, First-Served (FCFS), Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF), Shortest Job First (SJF), Round Robin, and Priority-Based scheduling.

## Algorithms

Each algorithm is implemented in Java and includes detailed explanations and examples to demonstrate its functionality.

- **FCFS (First-Come, First-Served)**: This algorithm schedules according to the arrival time of processes.
- **SRTF (Shortest Remaining Time First)**: This algorithm schedules the process with the smallest remaining burst time.
- **SJF (Shortest Job First)**: This algorithm schedules the shortest job first.
- **Round Robin**: This algorithm allocates a fixed time unit per process.
- **Priority-Based Scheduling**: This algorithm schedules based on priority.

## Usage

You can find the source code for each algorithm in its respective directory. Each directory contains example usage and test cases to showcase the functionality of the algorithm.

## Purpose

This repository serves as a resource for understanding and comparing different process scheduling strategies in the context of operating systems. It provides a practical reference for students and developers interested in learning about process scheduling algorithms in Java.

Feel free to explore each algorithm's implementation and contribute to enhance the repository with additional examples or improvements.
