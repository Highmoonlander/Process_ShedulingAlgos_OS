# First-Come-First-Served_Process-Scheduling_OS
FCFS is a non-preemptive CPU scheduling algorithm that executes processes in the order they arrive. It is the simplest and easiest scheduling algorithm to implement. In this algorithm, the process that requests the CPU first gets the CPU allocation first. The processes are managed with a FIFO queue.

Usage->

To use this program, follow these steps:
Compile the program using a C compiler such as GCC.
Run the program and enter the number of processes, arrival time, and burst time of each process as prompted.
The program will output the waiting time and turn around time for each process, as well as the average waiting time and average turn around time for all the processes.

Advantages->

Easy to implement and use.
Supports non-preemptive and pre-emptive scheduling algorithm.

Disadvantages->

Poor performance, and the general wait time is quite high.
Average waiting time is not optimal.
Cannot utilize resources in parallel, resulting in convoy effect.
